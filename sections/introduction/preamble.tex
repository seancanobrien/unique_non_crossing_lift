Let $F_n$ denote the free group of rank  $n$, generated by  $A \coloneq \Set{a_1,\ldots,a_n} $.
Let $U_n$ denote the free product of $n$ copies of  $\Z /2\Z$.
This should be thought of as the \emph{universal Coxeter group of rank  $n$}, since all rank  $n$ Coxeter groups are naturally a quotient of  $U_n$.
Let $S \coloneq \Set{s_1,\ldots,s_n} $ be the natural generating set for $U$, such that each  $s_i$ generates the  $i^\text{th}$ free factor.
For the whole of this document,  $n$ will be constant and arbitrary, so we will drop  $n$ from the above two notations, preferring just  $F$ and $U$.

A reflection in $F$ is a conjugate of any $f_i$ in $F$.
Denote the set of all reflections in $F$ by $R$.
Similarly, a reflection in $U$ is a conjugate of  any  $s_i$ in $U$.
Denote the set of all reflections in $U$ by  $T$.
So, a reflection in $U$ is some word $wu_i w^{-1}$, where $w=u_1\ldots u_k$ is a word in $S$.
We may assume $ws_iw^{-1}$ is a reduced word.
Thus, since every generator in $S$ is of order 2, we may assume that $w$ is a positive word where each factor has exponent  $+1$,  i.e.~each $u_i \in S$, and each $u_i$ is not equal to  $u_{i+1}$.

Since we will be using this notation a lot, let $s_i: w$ denote  $ws_iw^{-1}$.
Let $\phi \colon F \to U$ be the surjective homomorphism defined by $a_i \mapsto u_i$.
A lift of a reflection $s_i : w$ in $U$ is a choice of a positive or negative power for each $u_i$ in $w$, i.e.~a choice of a length $2k +1$ element in $\phi^{-1}(s_i : w) \cap R$.

Let $\C_n$ denote $\C \setminus \Set{z_1,\ldots,z_n}$.
Our free group $F$ is $\pi_1(\C_n, z_0)$ for any  $z_0 \notin \Set{z_1,\ldots,z_n} $.
We make the choice of $\Set{z_1,\ldots,z_n}$ to be $n$ evenly spaced points on the imaginary axis and within the unit circle, and $z_0 = -1$.
We draw a line $\lambda_i$ from each  $z_i$ to $z_0$.
For reasons that will become clear, we draw these lines in a roundabout way.

We should think of these lines meeting  $z_0$ somehow, as in the
We can put these points on the sphere.

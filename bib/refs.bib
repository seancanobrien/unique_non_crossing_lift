  abstract = {We study a new monoid structure for Artin groups associated with finite Coxeter systems. Like the classical positive braid monoid, the new monoid is a Garside monoid. We give several equivalent constructions: algebraically, the new monoid arises when studying Coxeter systems in a ``dual'' way, replacing the pair (W,S) by (W,T), with T the set of all reflections; geometrically, it arises when looking at the reflection arrangement from a certain basepoint. In the type A case, we recover the monoid constructed by Birman, Ko and Lee. R{\'e}sum{\'e} Nous {\'e}tudions une nouvelle structure de mono{\"{\i}}de pour les groupes d'Artin associ{\'e}s aux syst{\`e}mes de Coxeter finis. Ce nouveau mono{\"{\i}}de est, tout comme le classique mono{\"{\i}}de des tresses positives, un mono{\"{\i}}de de Garside.

First, we present the basic aspects of discrete Morse theory for regular cell complexes in terms of the combinatorial structure of their face posets. We introduce the notion of a generalized shelling of a regular cell complex and describe how to construct a discrete Morse function associated with such a decomposition. An application of Forman's theory gives us generalizations of known results about the homotopy properties of shellable complexes. We also discuss an application to a set of complexes related to matroids.

This construction shows that the (co)homology of any Garside group G is easily computed given the lattice D, and there is a simple sufficient condition that implies G is a duality group. The universal covers of these K(pi,1)s enjoy Bestvina's weak non-positive curvature condition. Under a certain tameness condition, this implies that every solvable subgroup of G is virtually abelian.},

In recent years, Artin groups and their subgroups have proved to be a rich source of examples and counterexamples of interesting phenomena in geometry and group theory. Artin groups, like Coxeter groups, are defined by presentations of a particular form. A Coxeter graph is a finite, simplicial graph {$\Gamma$} with vertex set S and edges labeled by integers m {$\geq$} 2. We denote by m(s, t) the label on the edge connecting vertices s and t. By convention, m(s, t) = {$\infty$} if s, t are not connected by an edge. The Artin group associated to a Coxeter graph {$\Gamma$} is the group A given by the presentation},

Finite reflection groups acting on Euclidean spaces are discussed, and the first part ends with the construction of the affine Weyl groups, a class of Coxeter groups that plays a major role in Lie theory. The second part (which is logically independent of, but motivated by, the first) develops from scratch the properties of Coxeter groups in general, including the Bruhat ordering and the seminal work of Kazhdan and Lusztig on representations of Hecke algebras associated with Coxeter groups is introduced. Finally a number of interesting complementary topics as well as connections with Lie theory are sketched. The book concludes with an extensive bibliography on Coxeter groups and their applications.},

  abstract = {The irreducible euclidean Coxeter groups that naturally act geometrically on euclidean space are classified by the well-known extended Dynkin diagrams and these diagrams also encode the modified presentations that define the irreducible euclidean Artin groups. These Artin groups have remained mysterious with some exceptions until very recently. Craig Squier clarified the structure of the three examples with three generators more than twenty years ago and Fran{\c c}ois Digne more recently proved that two of the infinite families can be understood by constructing a dual presentation for each of these groups and showing that it forms an infinite-type Garside structure. In this article I establish that none of the remaining dual presentations for irreducible euclidean Artin groups correspond to Garside structures because their factorization posets fail to be lattices. These are the first known examples of Artin groups where all of their dual presentations fail to form Garside structures. Nevertheless, the results presented here about the cause of this failure form the foundation for a subsequent article in which the structure of euclidean Artin groups is finally clarified.},

  abstract = {Geometric combinatorialists often study partially ordered sets in which each covering relation has been assigned some sort of label. In this article we discuss how each such labeled poset naturally has a monoid, a group, and a cell complex associated with it. Moreover, when the labeled poset satisfies three simple combinatorial conditions, the connections among the poset, monoid, group, and complex are particularly close and interesting. Posets satisfying these three conditions are (roughly) equivalent to the notion of a Garside structure for a group as developed recently within geometric group theory by Patrick Dehornoy in [15]. The goal of this article is to provide a quick introduction to the combinatorial version of this notion of a Garside structure and, more specifically, to the particular combinatorial Garside structures which arise in the study of Coxeter groups and Artin groups. These are the labeled partially ordered sets that combinatorialists know as the generalized non-crossing partition lattices.},

Specifically we prove that every irreducible Euclidean Artin group is a torsion-free centerless group with a decidable word problem and a finite-dimensional classifying space. We do this by showing that each of these groups is isomorphic to a subgroup of a group with an infinite-type Garside structure. The Garside groups involved are introduced here for the first time. They are constructed by applying semi-standard procedures to crystallographic groups that contain Euclidean Coxeter groups but which need not be generated by the reflections they contain.},

This is a long-standing problem, due to Arnol'd, Pham, and Thom. Our proof is based on recent advancements in the theory of dual Coxeter and Artin groups, as well as on several new results and constructions. In particular: we show that all affine noncrossing partition posets are EL-shellable; we use these posets to construct finite classifying spaces for dual affine Artin groups; we introduce new CW models for the orbit configuration spaces associated with arbitrary Coxeter groups; we construct finite classifying spaces for the braided crystallographic groups introduced by McCammond and Sulway.},
